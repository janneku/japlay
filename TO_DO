japlay "to do" list:

* Sort files that are added to playlist
* Unknown fileformat should not prevent advancement in playlist.
  Currently unknown fileformat stops playback completely.
* Playlist entry re-ordering
* Playlist entry queueing
* XMMS/Winamp compatible key bindings
* Configurable key bindings
* Repeat mode
* Support for subsongs. We could add a playlist entry for each subsong to allow
  subsongs to be played in random order (shuffle).
* Implement generic I/O backend to enable streaming of all supported file
  formats (http).
